          <h3>About Me</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>My name is Liam Söderström, and I am deeply passionate about analyzing problems and solving them through data-oriented approaches. Currently, I am currently studying AI development and Python programming, eager to expand my knowledge and expertise in these fields. Looking ahead, I am excited about the prospect of securing an internship opportunity, where I can apply my skills in a real-world setting, understand how theory is applied in a work environment and further develop my capabilities. Ultimately, I am committed to pursuing a career path where I can continue to innovate, problem-solve, and be part of an expanding tech sector.</p>

          <h3>What do I Know</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Python</h4>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Through my tasks, I have developed my knowledge in a Linux development environment on how I perform my role as a developer. Firstly, I have attained a good understanding of Python class implementation, which is how a Python class is created and what it consists of. Additionally, I have become acquainted with various design patterns such as the Observer Pattern and Protocol, which have strengthened my ability to create code structures, with knowledge of how nominal and structural syntaxes work.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Web Development</h4>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>I have experience in creating basic websites with HTML and CSS, in addition to experience in handling Flask API extension to back end servers and databases. With further experience in dealing with client-side work environments, networking, and server maintenance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>AI</h4>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>With a fundamental theoretical background in AI, I have continued to apply theory in practice with Pytorch, scikit-learn, and then Tensorflow. With these tools, I have gone from creating tensors to non-linear neural networks able to identify labeled 2D pictures.</p>
